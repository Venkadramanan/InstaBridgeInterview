# Orchard Core 2.0.0

Release date: Not yet released

## Upgrade Instructions

Before upgrading to Orchard Core 2.0, you should first upgrade to 1.8, address any warnings, and only then upgrade to 2.0. Be sure to review the list of breaking changes documented below to ensure a seamless transition.

## Breaking Changes

### Drop `Newtonsoft.Json` Support

The utilization of [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json) has been discontinued in both **YesSql** and **OrchardCore**. Instead, we have transitioned to utilize `System.Text.Json` due to its enhanced performance capabilities. To ensure compatibility with `System.Text.Json` during the serialization or deserialization of objects, the following steps need to be undertaken:

  - If you are using a custom deployment steps, change how you register it by using the new `AddDeployment<>` extension. This extension adds a new service that is required for proper serialization. For instance, instead of registering your deployment step like this:

```csharp
services.AddTransient<IDeploymentSource, AdminMenuDeploymentSource>();
services.AddSingleton<IDeploymentStepFactory>(new DeploymentStepFactory<AdminMenuDeploymentStep>());
services.AddScoped<IDisplayDriver<DeploymentStep>, AdminMenuDeploymentStepDriver>();
```

change it to the following:

```csharp
services.AddDeployment<AdminMenuDeploymentSource, AdminMenuDeploymentStep, AdminMenuDeploymentStepDriver>();
```

  - If you are using a custom AdminMenu node, change how you register it by using the new `AddAdminNode<>` extension. This extension adds a new service that is required for proper serialization. For instance, instead of registering your custom admin menu nodep like this:

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<IAdminNodeProviderFactory>(new AdminNodeProviderFactory<PlaceholderAdminNode>());
services.AddScoped<IAdminNodeNavigationBuilder, PlaceholderAdminNodeNavigationBuilder>();
services.AddScoped<IDisplayDriver<MenuItem>, PlaceholderAdminNodeDriver>();
```

change it to the following:

```csharp
services.AddAdminNode<PlaceholderAdminNode, PlaceholderAdminNodeNavigationBuilder, PlaceholderAdminNodeDriver>();
```

  - Any serializable object that contains a polymorphic property (a base type that can contain sub-classes instances) needs to register all possible sub-classes this way:

```csharp
services.AddJsonDerivedTypeInfo<UrlCondition, Condition>();
```

Alternatively, you can simplify your code by using the newly added extensions to register custom conditions. For example,

```csharp
services.AddRule<HomepageCondition, HomepageConditionEvaluator, HomepageConditionDisplayDriver>();
```

 - Any type introduced in custom modules inheriting from `MenuItem`, `AdminNode`, `Condition`, `ConditionOperator`, `Query`, `SitemapType` will have to register the class using the `services.AddJsonDerivedTypeInfo<>` method. For example,

```csharp
services.AddJsonDerivedTypeInfo<SqlQuery, Query>();
```

 - The extension `PopulateSettings<T>(model)` was removed from `PartFieldDefinition`. If you are using this method in your code, you'll have to get the settings using the `Settings` object directly. For instance, if you have this code,

 ```csharp
 public override IDisplayResult Edit(ContentPartFieldDefinition partFieldDefinition)
 {
    return Initialize<NumericFieldSettings>("NumericFieldSettings_Edit", model => partFieldDefinition.PopulateSettings(model));
 }
 ```

 You'll change it to the following:

 ```csharp
  public override IDisplayResult Edit(ContentPartFieldDefinition partFieldDefinition)
 {
    return Initialize<NumericFieldSettings>("NumericFieldSettings_Edit", model => 
    {
        var settings = partFieldDefinition.Settings.ToObject<NumericFieldSettings>();
        model.Hint = settings.Hint;
        // ...
    });
 }
 ```

### Twitter Module

The `Twitter` module has been rebranded to `X`.

If you were using the `OrchardCore_Twitter` configuration key to configure the module, please update the configuration key to `OrchardCore_X`. The `OrchardCore_Twitter` key continues to work but will be deprecated in a future release.

### Users Module

- The `Login.cshtml` has undergone a significant revamp. The previous `AfterLogin` zone, which allowed filters for injecting shapes, has been replaced. Now, you can inject shapes using drivers by implementing `IDisplayDriver<LoginForm>`. For example, the 'Forgot Password?' link is injected using the following driver:

```csharp
public class ForgotPasswordLoginFormDisplayDriver : DisplayDriver<LoginForm>
{
    private readonly ISiteService _siteService;

    public ForgotPasswordLoginFormDisplayDriver(ISiteService siteService)
    {
        _siteService = siteService;
    }

    public override async Task<IDisplayResult> EditAsync(LoginForm model, BuildEditorContext context)
    {
        var settings = (await _siteService.GetSiteSettingsAsync()).As<ResetPasswordSettings>();

        if (!settings.AllowResetPassword)
        {
            return null;
        }

        return View("LoginFormForgotPassword_Edit", model).Location("Links:5");
    }
}
```

- The `ForgotPassword.cshtml` has undergone a significant revamp. The previous `AfterForgotPassword` zone, which allowed filters for injecting shapes, has been replaced. Now, you can inject shapes using drivers by implementing `IDisplayDriver<ForgotPasswordForm>`. For example, the ReCaptcha shape is injected using the following driver:

```csharp
public class ReCaptchaForgotPasswordFormDisplayDriver : DisplayDriver<ForgotPasswordForm>
{
    private readonly ISiteService _siteService;

    public ReCaptchaForgotPasswordFormDisplayDriver(ISiteService siteService)
    {
        _siteService = siteService;
    }

    public override async Task<IDisplayResult> EditAsync(ForgotPasswordForm model, BuildEditorContext context)
    {
        var _reCaptchaSettings = (await _siteService.GetSiteSettingsAsync()).As<ReCaptchaSettings>();

        if (!_reCaptchaSettings.IsValid())
        {
            return null;
        }

        return View("FormReCaptcha_Edit", model).Location("Content:after");
    }
}
```

- The `ResetPassword.cshtml` has undergone a significant revamp. The previous `AfterResetPassword` zone, which allowed filters for injecting shapes, has been replaced. Now, you can inject shapes using drivers by implementing `IDisplayDriver<ResetPasswordForm>`. For example, the ReCaptcha shape is injected using the following driver:

```csharp
public class ReCaptchaResetPasswordFormDisplayDriver : DisplayDriver<ResetPasswordForm>
{
    private readonly ISiteService _siteService;

    public ReCaptchaResetPasswordFormDisplayDriver(ISiteService siteService)
    {
        _siteService = siteService;
    }

    public override async Task<IDisplayResult> EditAsync(ResetPasswordForm model, BuildEditorContext context)
    {
        var _reCaptchaSettings = (await _siteService.GetSiteSettingsAsync()).As<ReCaptchaSettings>();

        if (!_reCaptchaSettings.IsValid())
        {
            return null;
        }

        return View("FormReCaptcha_Edit", model).Location("Content:after");
    }
}
```

Previously, users were only able to reset their password through email when the "Reset Password" feature was enabled. However, we've enhanced this functionality to offer users the flexibility of resetting their password using either their email or username. Consequently, the `Email` property on both the `ForgotPasswordViewModel` and `ResetPasswordViewModel` have been deprecated and should be replaced with the new `UsernameOrEmail` property for password resets.

- The `Register.cshtml` has undergone a significant revamp. The previous `AfterRegister` zone, which allowed filters for injecting shapes, has been replaced. Now, you can inject shapes using drivers by implementing `IDisplayDriver<RegisterUserForm>`. For example, the ReCaptcha shape is injected using the following driver:

```csharp
public class RegisterUserFormDisplayDriver : DisplayDriver<RegisterUserForm>
{
    private readonly ISiteService _siteService;

    public RegisterUserFormDisplayDriver(ISiteService siteService)
    {
        _siteService = siteService;
    }

    public override async Task<IDisplayResult> EditAsync(RegisterUserForm model, BuildEditorContext context)
    {
        var _reCaptchaSettings = (await _siteService.GetSiteSettingsAsync()).As<ReCaptchaSettings>();

        if (!_reCaptchaSettings.IsValid())
        {
            return null;
        }

        return View("FormReCaptcha_Edit", model).Location("Content:after");
    }
}
```
### Media Indexing

Previously, `.pdf` files were automatically indexed in the search providers (Elasticsearch, Lucene or Azure AI Search). Now, if you want to continue to index `.PDF` file you'll need to enable the `OrchardCore.Media.Indexing.Pdf` feature.

Additionally, if you need to enable indexing for text file with `.txt`, `.md` extensions, you will need the `OrchardCore.Media.Indexing.Text` feature.

If you need to enable indexing for other extensions like (`.docx`, or `.pptx`), you will need the `OrchardCore.Media.Indexing.OpenXML` feature.

### SMS Module

In the past, we utilized the injection of `ISmsProvider` for sending SMS messages. However, in this release, it is now necessary to inject `ISmsService` instead.

Additionally, `Twilio` provider is no longer enabled by default. If you want to use Twilio SMS provider, you must enable the provider by visiting the email settings `Configuration` > `Settings` > `Email` and see the `Twilio` tab.

### Display Management

In this release, the signatures of the `UpdateAsync()` method within the `SectionDisplayDriver` base class have undergone modifications. Previously, these signatures accepted the `BuildEditorContext` parameter. However, with this update, all signatures now require the `UpdateEditorContext` instead. This alteration necessitates that every driver inheriting from this class adjusts their contexts accordingly.

Here are the updated signatures:

1. **From:**
   `Task<IDisplayResult> UpdateAsync(TModel model, TSection section, IUpdateModel updater, BuildEditorContext context)`
   **To:**
   `Task<IDisplayResult> UpdateAsync(TModel model, TSection section, IUpdateModel updater, UpdateEditorContext context)`

2. **From:**
   `Task<IDisplayResult> UpdateAsync(TSection section, IUpdateModel updater, BuildEditorContext context)`
   **To:**
   `Task<IDisplayResult> UpdateAsync(TSection section, IUpdateModel updater, UpdateEditorContext context)`

3. **From:**
   `Task<IDisplayResult> UpdateAsync(TSection section, BuildEditorContext context)`
   **To:**
   `Task<IDisplayResult> UpdateAsync(TSection section, UpdateEditorContext context)`

These adjustments ensure compatibility and adherence to the latest conventions within the `SectionDisplayDriver` class.

## Change Logs

### Azure AI Search Module

Introducing a new "Azure AI Search" module, designed to empower you in the administration of Azure AI Search indices. When enabled with the "Search" module, it facilitates frontend full-text search capabilities through Azure AI Search. For more info read the [Azure AI Search](../reference/modules/AzureAISearch/README.md) docs.

### New ImageSharp Image Caches for Azure Blob and AWS S3 Storage

The Microsoft Azure Media and Amazon S3 Media modules have new features for replacing the default `PhysicalFileSystemCache` of ImageSharp that stores resized images in the local `App_Data` folder. Instead, you can now use Azure Blob Storage with the Azure Media ImageSharp Image Cache feature (that utilizes [`AzureBlobStorageImageCache`](https://docs.sixlabors.com/articles/imagesharp.web/imagecaches.html#azureblobstorageimagecache)), and AWS S3 with the Amazon Media ImageSharp Image Cache feature (that utilizes [`AWSS3StorageCache`](https://docs.sixlabors.com/articles/imagesharp.web/imagecaches.html#awss3storagecache)). Depending on your use case, this can provide various advantages. Check out [the Azure Media](../reference/modules/Media.Azure/README.md) and [the Amazon S3 Media](../reference/modules/Media.AmazonS3/README.md) docs for details.

### Deployment Module

Added new extensions to make registering custom deployment step easier:

- `services.AddDeployment<TSource, TStep>()`.
- `services.AddDeployment<TSource, TStep, TDisplayDriver>()`.
- `services.AddDeploymentWithoutSource<TStep, TDisplayDriver>()`.

### Workflow Module

 The method `Task TriggerEventAsync(string name, IDictionary<string, object> input = null, string correlationId = null, bool isExclusive = false, bool isAlwaysCorrelated = false)` 
 was changed to return `Task<IEnumerable<WorkflowExecutionContext>>` instead.
 
#### CorrelationId

**Breaking change:**
`CreateContentTask`, `RetrieveContentTask`, and `UpdateContentTask`, in previous versions, the workflow's CorrelationId was updated each time with the ContentItemId of the current content item;
Now, the CorrelationId value will only be updated if the current workflow's CorrelationId is empty.

Also added a workflow-scoped script function `setCorrelationId(id:string): void`, that you can use to update the workflow's CorrelationId.


### GraphQL Module

When identifying content types for GraphQL exposure, we identify those without a stereotype to provide you with control over the behavior of stereotyped content types. A new option, `DiscoverableSterotypes`, has been introduced in `GraphQLContentOptions`. This allows you to specify stereotypes that should be discoverable by default.

For instance, if you have several content types stereotyped as `ExampleStereotype`, you can make them discoverable by incorporating the following code into the startup class:

```csharp
services.Configure<GraphQLContentOptions>(options =>
{
    options.DiscoverableSterotypes.Add("ExampleStereotype");
});
```

### Email Module

The `OrchardCore.Email` module has undergone a refactoring process with no breaking changes. However, there are compile-time warnings that are recommended to be addressed. Here is a summary of the changes:

 - Previously, we used the injection of `ISmtpService` for sending email messages. In this release, it is now necessary to inject `IEmailService` instead.
 - The `SMTP` related services are now part of a new module named `OrchardCore.Email.Smtp`. To use the SMTP provider for sending emails, enable the `OrchardCore.Email.Smtp` feature.
 - If you were using the `OrchardCore_Email` configuration key to set up the SMTP provider for all tenants, please update the configuration key to `OrchardCore_Email_Smtp`. The `OrchardCore_Email` key continues to work but will be deprecated in a future release.
 - A new email provider was added to allow you to send email using Azure Communication Services Email. Click [here](../reference/modules/Email.Azure/README.md) to read more about the ACS module.
 
### Admin Menu

The admin menu has undergone performance enhancements, and new helpers have been added. When incorporating `INavigationProvider` in your project, you can now utilize `NavigationHelper.IsAdminMenu(name)` instead of the previous approach using `string.Equals(name, "admin", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)`. Moreover, when passing route values to an action, it is advised to store them in a constant variable. An illustrative example is provided below.

```csharp
public class AdminMenu : INavigationProvider
{
    private static readonly RouteValueDictionary _routeValues = new()
    {
        { "area", "OrchardCore.Settings" },
        { "groupId", AdminSiteSettingsDisplayDriver.GroupId },
    };

    protected readonly IStringLocalizer S;

    public AdminMenu(IStringLocalizer<AdminMenu> stringLocalizer)
    {
        S = stringLocalizer;
    }

    public Task BuildNavigationAsync(string name, NavigationBuilder builder)
    {
        if (!NavigationHelper.IsAdminMenu(name))
        {
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }

        builder
            .Add(S["Configuration"], configuration => configuration
                .Add(S["Settings"], settings => settings
                    .Add(S["Admin"], S["Admin"].PrefixPosition(), admin => admin
                        .AddClass("admin")
                        .Id("admin")
                        .Action("Index", "Admin", _routeValues)
                        .Permission(PermissionsAdminSettings.ManageAdminSettings)
                        .LocalNav()
                    )
                )
            );

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

### Admin Routes

The `[Admin]` attribute now has optional parameters for a custom route template and route name. It works just like the `[Route(template, name)]` attribute, except it prepends the configured admin prefix. You can apply it to the controller or the action; if both are specified then the action's template takes precedence. The route name can contain `{area}`, `{controller}`, and `{action}`, which are substituted during mapping so the names can be unique for each action. This means you don't have to define these admin routes in your module's `Startup` class anymore, but that option is still available and supported. Take a look at this example:

```csharp
[Admin("Person/{action}/{id?}", "Person{action}")]
public class PersonController : Controller
{
    [Admin("Person", "Person")]
    public IActionResult Index() { ... }

    public IActionResult Create() { ... }

    public IActionResult Edit(string id) { ... }
}
```

In this example, (if the admin prefix remains the default "Admin") you can reach the Index action at `~/Admin/Person` (or by the route name `Person`), because its own action-level attribute took precedence. You can reach Create at `~/Admin/Person/Create` (route name `PersonCreate`) and Edit for the person whose identifier string is "john-doe" at `~/Admin/Person/john-doe` (route name `PersonEdit`).

### Users Module

Added a new User Localization feature that allows to be able to configure the culture per user from the admin UI.

### Navbar

Added a new `Navbar()` function to Liquid to allow building the `Navbar` shape using Liquid. Here are the steps needed to add the `Navbar` shape into your custom Liquid shape:

1. Construct the shape at the beginning of the `layout.liquid` file to enable navbar items to potentially contribute to the resources output as necessary.

```
{% assign navbar = Navbar() | shape_render %}
```
2. Subsequently in the `layout.liquid` file, invoke the shape at the location where you want to display it.

```
{{ navbar }}
```

### Notifications Module

The`INotificationMessage` interface was updated to includes the addition of a `Subject` field, which facilitates the rendering of notification titles. Moreover, the existing `Summary` field has been transitioned to HTML format. This adjustment enables the rendering of HTML notifications in both the navigation bar and the notification center. Consequently, HTML notifications can now be created, affording functionalities such as clickable notifications.

Furthermore, the introduction of the `NotificationOptions` provides configuration capabilities for the notifications module. This structure comprises the following attributes:

- `TotalUnreadNotifications`: This property determines the maximum number of unread notifications displayed in the navigation bar, with a default setting of 10.
- `DisableNotificationHtmlBodySanitizer`: By default, the `HtmlBody` of notifications generated from workflows undergoes a sanitization process. However, this property grants the option to bypass this sanitization process.

### Secure media files

Introduces a new "Secure Media" feature for additional control over who can access media files. For more info read the [Secure Media](../reference/modules/Media/README.md#secure-media) docs.

### Users Module

Enhanced functionality has been implemented, giving developers the ability to control the expiration time of different tokens, such as those for password reset, email confirmation, and email change, which are sent through the email service. Below, you'll find a comprehensive list of configurable options along with their default values: 
 
 | Class Name | Default Expiration Value |
 | ---------- | ------------------------ |
 | `ChangeEmailTokenProviderOptions` | The token is valid by default for **15 minutes**. |
 | `EmailConfirmationTokenProviderOptions` | The token is valid by default for **48 hours**. |
 | `PasswordResetTokenProviderOptions` | The token is valid by default for **15 minutes**. |

 You may change the default values of these options by using the `services.Configure<>` method. For instance, to change the `EmailConfirmationTokenProviderOptions` you can add the following code to your project

 ```csharp
 services.Configure<EmailConfirmationTokenProviderOptions>(options => options.TokenLifespan = TimeSpan.FromDays(7));
 ```

### Reloading Tenants

The recent addition in the [Pull Request](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/pull/15875) introduces the `IShellReleaseManager`, enabling you to initiate a shell release at the request's conclusion via the `RequestRelease()` method. This action is accessible from any service within the application. However, there's no assurance of immediate fulfillment since another service may utilize the same service and suspend the release request later. Should you need to suspend the request to release the shell, you can utilize the `SuspendReleaseRequest()` method to suspend the tenant release request and the tenant will not be released.

#### Reloading Tenants Display Drivers

When implementing a site settings display driver, you have the option to reload the shell (restart the tenant). If you choose to do so, manually releasing the shell context using `await _shellHost.ReleaseShellContextAsync(_shellSettings)` is unnecessary. Instead, you should use the new `IShellReleaseManager.RequestRelease()`. This ensures that the shell stays intact until all settings are validated. For instance, in `ReverseProxySettingsDisplayDriver`, the code was modified from this:

```csharp
public class ReverseProxySettingsDisplayDriver : SectionDisplayDriver<ISite, ReverseProxySettings>
{
    //
    // For  example simplicity, other methods are not visible.
    //

    public override async Task<IDisplayResult> UpdateAsync(ReverseProxySettings section, UpdateEditorContext context)
    {
        var user = _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext?.User;

        if (!await _authorizationService.AuthorizeAsync(user, Permissions.ManageReverseProxySettings))
        {
            return null;
        }

        if (context.GroupId.EqualsOrdinalIgnoreCase(GroupId))
        {
            //
            // For  example simplicity, other logic are not visible.
            //

            // If the settings are valid, release the current tenant.
            if (context.Updater.ModelState.IsValid)
            {
                await _shellHost.ReleaseShellContextAsync(_shellSettings);
            }
        }

        return await EditAsync(section, context);
    }
}
```

To this:

```csharp
public class ReverseProxySettingsDisplayDriver : SectionDisplayDriver<ISite, ReverseProxySettings>
{
    private readonly IShellReleaseManager _shellReleaseManager;
    private readonly IHttpContextAccessor _httpContextAccessor;
    private readonly IAuthorizationService _authorizationService;

    public ReverseProxySettingsDisplayDriver(
        // (1) Inject the new service.
        IShellReleaseManager shellReleaseManager
        IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor,
        IAuthorizationService authorizationService)
    {
        _shellReleaseManager = shellReleaseManager;
        _httpContextAccessor = httpContextAccessor;
        _authorizationService = authorizationService;
    }

    //
    // For  example simplicity, other methods are not visible.
    //

    public override async Task<IDisplayResult> UpdateAsync(ReverseProxySettings settings, UpdateEditorContext context)
    {
        var user = _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext?.User;

        if (!await _authorizationService.AuthorizeAsync(user, Permissions.ManageReverseProxySettings))
        {
            return null;
        }

        if (context.GroupId.EqualsOrdinalIgnoreCase(GroupId))
        {
            //
            // For  example simplicity, other logic are not visible.
            //

            // (2) Request a release at the end of the request.
            _shellReleaseManager.RequestRelease();
        }

        return await EditAsync(settings, context);
    }
}
```
